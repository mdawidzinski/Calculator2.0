### Limitations

    The calculator uses Python's built-in eval() function to evaluate expressions, which can be vulnerable to code injection attacks. Use with caution.
    The calculator uses floating-point arithmetic to perform calculations, which can result in rounding errors and imprecise results for certain operations.
    The calculator rounds the result to the nearest 10^-13 to reduce this error, but it may still occur in some cases.

### Requirements

    Python 3.x
    
### Instalation

  To run the calculator, simply run the main.py file with a Python interpreter.
